# FinalProject

For Milestone 1 of my project, I started with designing a shape grammar. I use cylinders and boxes of random colors stacked on top of each other. In some cases, the newest level is replaced by two/three/four/eight smaller cubes or cylinders in set locations. After this, I designed the arrangement of my shape grammar onto a cylinder. I wanted my cylinder to have a pill-like look. I managed to add small cylinders in places I would like to add my shape grammar. However, when I tried to replace my shape the cylinders with my shape grammar, the direction was off. I still have to work on fixing the direction. I'm sure there's a very small bit I'm missing, perhaps with a fresh mind I'll be able to debug it.

My project is available at https://anvidalal.github.io/FinalProject/ .
I have added checkboxes for shapeGrammar and layout, to view them separately.
When viewing them together, there is a lag of about 5 seconds before anything appears.
