# Final Project - Music Visualizer
## CIS700 Procedural Graphics, Spring 2017
## Grace Xu 

Using:
- Web Audio API
- Three.js
- Node.js 
- Meyda? (for extracting information from audio)

Ideas for visualizations: 
- Basic noise cloud (adapted from HW#1)
- Tempo drives camera control 
- Moving line with perturbations driven by amplitude of music

To-do:
- Be able to upload audio file
- Be able to extract useful information from audio file, e.g.:
	- frequency
	- amplitude/loudness
	- note?
	- tempo (BPM)
- Have at least 4 different visualizations
- Implement camera controller or controller that switches between visualizations at appropiate points in the music
